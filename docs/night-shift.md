# night shift — torus.wtf

Autonomous improvement loop for the visualizer. One **Architect** run each morning replaces the Priority list below with ten ranked ideas; **Builder** runs through the day each ship one idea as a PR. A human reviews every PR and merges at the end of the day — nothing lands on `main` without review.

**The mission:** make the visualizers more fluid, more alive, more beautiful.

- *Fluid* — motion quality. Easing, springs, inertia, continuity. Nothing pops, snaps, or moves linearly unless it's a deliberate hit on a transient.
- *Alive* — the feeling of a living thing. Idle breathing, anticipation, organic variation, deeper audio-reactivity (transients, beat phase, spectral nuance — see `packages/visualizers/src/metrics.ts`), behavior that surprises without ever feeling random.
- *Beautiful* — color, light, and composition. Palette life, bloom discipline, camera choreography, framing that owns the screen (see the "Pulse Update" framing philosophy in `packages/visualizers/src/registry.ts`).

## Shared rules

**Scope — where night shift has full creative power:**

- `packages/visualizers/` — presets (`src/presets/`), the engine (`SceneRig.tsx`, `modulation.tsx`, `livingPalette.tsx`, `metrics.ts`, `BackgroundLayer.tsx`, `AuraLayer.tsx`, `cameraZoom.tsx`, `VisualizerCanvas.tsx`), control schema and registry defaults.
- `apps/visualizer/` — visualizer UI polish and control wiring only where an idea requires it.
- New presets are welcome: one self-contained R3F component in `packages/visualizers/src/presets/` plus a registry entry (per `CONTRIBUTING.md`). New preset controls go through `controlSchema.ts` + `presetControls` — the panel renders them generically; never hand-build UI for one preset.

**Hard rules — inherited from `apps/visualizer/ROADMAP.md`; violating any means abort the run and leave a note in the Built log instead of a PR:**

1. Only touch `apps/visualizer/` and `packages/visualizers/`. Never touch `apps/web/`, `apps/worker/`, `packages/db/`, `packages/storage/`, `packages/ui/`, billing, auth, or migrations.
2. Never push to `main`. Builders always work on a feature branch and open a PR; the Architect only ever pushes `night-shift`.
3. Never modify `PRINCIPLES.md`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
4. Never add analytics, tracking, third-party SDKs, ad scripts, telemetry, or any external script tag.
5. Never break the torus.wtf clip player (`apps/web/src/components/ClipPlayer.tsx` + `VisualizerViewport.tsx`). New `@torus/visualizers` props must be optional and default to current behavior.
6. Never break the `VisualizerSceneProps` contract — additions must be optional props that existing presets can ignore.
7. Never gate live preview behind the paid unlock. Only export quality / format / extras are paid.
8. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` in any new animated UI.
9. New runtime dependencies only if small, well-justified in the PR body, and license-compatible (AGPL). Prefer zero.

**Performance and accessibility are part of beauty:**

- Every preset supports `tier: 'high' | 'mid' | 'low'`. New visual work must degrade gracefully — no idea ships if it tanks mid-tier. State the tier behavior in the PR.
- Aim for 60 fps on high tier. Prefer shader/instancing work over per-frame allocations; no per-frame GC churn.
- Accessibility bugs are real bugs here (see `PRINCIPLES.md`).

**Style:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` applies — TypeScript (no unjustified `any`), Prettier, Conventional Commits, comments only for non-obvious intent.

**Coordination mechanics:**

- The `night-shift` branch is the shared ledger; this file is the only file the Architect and the claim/log steps of Builders edit on it.
- Never rebase or force-push `night-shift`. Always `git fetch` and pull the latest `night-shift` immediately before editing the ledger, and push immediately after — the window between claim and push is the race you're avoiding.
- The Built log is append-only.

## Architect role

Runs once each morning. Never opens a PR; never pushes anything except `night-shift`.

1. Work only on the `night-shift` branch — create it from `origin/main` if it doesn't exist. Sync this file with any newer copy on `origin/night-shift` first.
2. Ground yourself: read `PRINCIPLES.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the hard rules in `apps/visualizer/ROADMAP.md`, the engine and presets under `packages/visualizers/src/`, recent commits on `main`, the Built log below, and open PRs.
3. Replace the Priority list below with **exactly 10 ideas, ranked best-first** by expected impact on fluid / alive / beautiful.
4. Each idea must be small enough for a single Builder pass (one PR, one sitting) and must not duplicate the Built log, an open PR, or an unchecked item on the `apps/visualizer/ROADMAP.md` execution queue. Unbuilt ideas from yesterday may be re-ranked, rewritten, or dropped freely.
5. Mix scales across the list: some single-preset polish, some engine-wide motion/color/reactivity work, occasionally a whole new preset (a new preset is one idea, not several).
6. Commit the updated list and push `night-shift`.

**Priority item format:**

```
- [ ] NS-YYYYMMDD-NN (S|M) **Title** — what changes on screen, and why it reads as more fluid/alive/beautiful. Area: <files or presets>. Accept: <one observable check>.
```

## Builder role

Runs several times a day. Ships exactly one item per run.

1. `git fetch`, then read the Priority list from the `night-shift` branch (or from `main` if that branch doesn't exist yet).
2. Take the **highest-priority item that is unclaimed, not built, and has no open PR** — exactly one item per run, never a second take of the same item. If everything is claimed or built, stop cleanly without a PR.
3. Claim it first: on `night-shift`, mark the item `[~] building <ISO timestamp>` and push. If the push is rejected, re-fetch and re-check the list — someone else may have claimed it.
4. Branch off the latest `origin/main` as `agent/<yyyymmdd>-<slug>` and implement a working first draft. Rough edges in code are acceptable; broken or half-rendered visuals are not — it must *look* intentional and feel like the mission.
5. Verify (the boot check):
   - `pnpm install`
   - `pnpm typecheck` && `pnpm lint` && `pnpm test`
   - `pnpm --filter @torus/visualizer build`
   - Fix what they surface. If the environment genuinely cannot run them, prefix the PR title with `[UNVERIFIED]`.
6. Open a PR titled with a conventional commit (e.g. `feat(visualizer): …`), body containing:
   - what changed on screen and why it serves fluid / alive / beautiful,
   - **exact steps to see it** — route, preset, suggested audio (e.g. "bass-heavy track"), and what to look for,
   - tier behavior (high / mid / low) and any perf notes,
   - risks or follow-ups.
7. Back on `night-shift`: check the item off with the PR link (`[x] … — PR #NN`) and append a Built log entry. Push.
8. Never push to `main`.
